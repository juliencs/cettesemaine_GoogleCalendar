# cettesemaine_GoogleCalendar
Hi there!
I created this code because I wanted an easy way to keep track of the biochemistry talks happening on the UofT campus. 
cettesemaine.utoronto.ca is an amazing website to do just that, but it does not have a Google Calendar plugin.
I decided to webscrape the site and automatically create a csv file that can be easily uploaded to Google Calendar or iCal. 
To use this code you will need to install selenium on your computer and the chromedriver executable (if you use Chrome).
You will need to edit a few lines in the code, so your computer knows where to find the executable.
You can find more information on how to install selenium at https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/.

See you at a talk!
